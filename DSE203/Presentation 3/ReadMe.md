* Find books that have been generally in high demand over the last year.
* Is there a category that we should discontinue stocking?

Each group (Demand Prediction and Product Recommendation) needs to pick five questions. For example, the demand prediction group as a whole will pick five questions. All four teams in this group will create their presentation based on the same five questions. 

A few things we would like you to address:
* If the query is already supported, what is the workflow for your teams? 
* If this query is asked multiple times, how will you optimize it?If the query is not supported, you need to make a call whether to support this query or not. If you cannot support this query, explain why not [At max one query that you cannot support. If there seem to be multiple, assume additional data being available and then write how you would support it]. If you can, again, write the steps involved in supporting this along with the questions asked in the first point. 

We expect each question to be answered in one to four slides. They may be backed by some type of actual queries, visualizations, schema definitions or datalog queries.
