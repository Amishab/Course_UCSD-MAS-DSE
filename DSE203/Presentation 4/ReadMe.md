## Presentation 4 - Due 11/17

On Nov 17, we expect each team to present the status of their implementation, which will contribute towards Presentation 4 of this course.
At a high level, each team must include in their presentations what has been covered, what is left, and if there are any known gaps in the implementation. 
Once again, please stick to seven slides in seven minutes. 

Here are the details that you should cover:
### Data Exploration teams
* Current implementational status, completeness of tasks, and pending tasks 
* Performance and benchmarking for scalability of APIs

### Schema Integration teams
* What/how many views have been created? 
* What are you doing to handle non-SQL cases?
* Status of implementation of view unfolding functionality and how is it consistent with ML team's ask

### Query Processing teams
* Status of implementation of APIs/datalog query processing for each source
* How are you combining the results coming out of multiple sources?

### Machine Learning teams
* How are you measuring the quality of your model(s)?
* What is the training process being followed?
* If the data were to become 10x or 100x, would you be able to scale? 

In the final presentation on 12/8, the presentations would be vertical, that is, the four teams in each group will present together.
The teams in one group can come in any order and present their proof of concept, each group highlighting what they have done via small demos/quick code walkthroughs/visualizations etc.
